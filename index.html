<!-- Create a new HTML5 document and save it as index.html.
Add all the necessary HTML5 code and title your document “Assignment 1”.
Create a new folder called js and then create an external JavaScript file titled script.js within the js folder and link it into the HTML document. You will be performing all the tasks below within script.js.
Open script.js and add single-line comments for every step:
// STEP 1
// STEP 2
// STEP 3
Every step should be commented out when you push your final assignment to GitHub. So, you’ll do step 1, make sure you have it the way you want it to look or function, then comment it out. Then move to step 2. Make sure you have it the way you want it to look or function, comment it out, then move to step 3. Proceed like this until you’ve finished every step.
